        <h2>Learning by doing. Projects with IOT.</h2>
        <p>Key technologies: .NET Core, C in Arduino IDE</p>
        <p>Looking back in time, I remember my geeky self at the age of 12 making all sorts of electronics projects
            published in Practical Electronics. Truthfully, I had no idea what I was doing but I was essentially doing
            the electronics version of copy-paste but boy was it fun as I spend my time listening to bootleg mix tapes
            and smelling solder fumes. Fast forward in my career, I have left electronics behind for software but I
            still occasionally watch the random youtube videos on DIY electronics. Today, cheap microcontrollers and
            their connectivity to the cloud opens up a whole new type of electronics fun. </p>
        <p>So I embarked into projects to better understand the applications of a Raspberry-PI, Arduinos and ESP8622
            microcontrollers.</p>

            <mat-card-content>A full MEAN stack application that I use a Raspberry Pi to monitor and upload data from my
                dryer to a MongoDB database hosted on Atlas. A basic NodeJS server is written that is hosted on Heroku
                and then visualized using an AngularJS application hosted on Vercel. My family uses this to check on the
                dry cycle and I also use it to check on the current temperature/humidity since the sensor is mounted at
                the vent exit close to the outside of the house. </mat-card-content>

            <mat-card-content>This is the exact project as the RaspberryPI version described above. However this time I
                wanted to spec out a DIY kit that is inexpensive and also solve the issue of an
                end-user configuring the WIFI. I did the programming using an Arduino IDE. I am not a low level
                developer but have enough C/C++ knowledge to google around for the solution.</mat-card-content>

            <mat-card-content>In the pandemic of 2020 with teleconference being a staple of our and our kids lives, I
                was interested in monitoring my home
                internet bandwidth throughout the day. This a weekend hackathon to do just that and to document all the
                steps I took to put this together. I just love projects
                that challenges me to work through a deliverable from end to end.

            <mat-card-content>This was a quicky 1/2 day challenge to put together a WeatherStation type setup using
                SenseHat and a RaspberryPI. This time, I wanted to try it with .NET Core and Visual Studio 2019. Wow,
                what a joy to see intellisense, debugging and compile time syntax checking come alive. I love the MEAN
                stack but my first love of .NET makes me a bit teary. </mat-card-content>
