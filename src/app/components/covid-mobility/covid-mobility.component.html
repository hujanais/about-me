            Google published worldwide mobility data(csv) during the Covid-19 pandemic. Someone brought up this report
            at a
            zoom meeting on a Friday afternoon so I decided that I would look into writing a visualization tool over the
            weekend. It was a quick and dirty app to parse the CSV dataset and to provide the ability to visualize the
            trends on a graph. I actually gave this to my family and friends in other countries as well.
